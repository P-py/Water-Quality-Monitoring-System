# Why?

The project views viabilizing the process of monitoring water quality in any given reservatory, contributing for the determination of ambiental factors that affect water, being capable of detecting toxic chemicals, like heavy metals (mercury being one of them) on the given reservatory it helps preventing health problems and ambiental impact via irregular dump.

Proposing a new and simple solution to individual or comercial applications.

The initial motivation was given in one of [Alexandre Guassi's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandre-guassi-4008a3168/?trk=public_profile_browsemap&originalSubdomain=br) class in Faculty of Engineering of Sorocaba (FACENS), when seeing the situation of riverside communities at Baixo Tapaj√≥s, more details [here](https://www.wwf.org.br/?81968/Moradores-de-areas-urbanas-e-ribeirinhas-do-Baixo-Tapajos-tem-altas-taxas-de-exposicao-por-mercurio#:~:text=De%20acordo%20com%20o%20estudo,foi%20registrado%20na%20%C3%A1rea%20ribeirinha.).
